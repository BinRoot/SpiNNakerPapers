\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
% \interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:

\begin{abstract}
Artificial Neural Networks is a promising approach to study human brain computation. Recent computer architecture design of a low-power 72-core processor by the University of Manchester (SpiNNaker) has made it easier to study highly parallel networks. We designed an algorithm on the SpiNNaker chip to enable synaptic removal, addition, and randomization on a neural network topology during run-time. Additionally, we explored scalability issues and unintended pitfalls with this approach.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} human brain is fast and low in energy. [TODO: Matt] blah blah blah. One property of the brain is it's plasticity (cite Lashley, or some Psyc studies). Our approach to neural networks is greatly influenced by this biological idea, and we want to enable networks to self-modify. 
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph above
With energy effeciency in mind, we enable this functionality on the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker) provided by the University of Manchester. 

\subsection{SpiNNaker}
[TODO: Matt]
The SpiNNaker is cool. 
Here's why. (Energy effecient)
It's so epic. 
And we have one. 
And we added a cool functionality to it. 

\subsection{Synaptogensis}
[TODO: Matt]
Define Synaptogenesis and explain why it's cool.
Here's why. 
Explain it's previous success from Levy's work.

\hfill

[TODO: Matt] We're combining the two. And it's gonna be super userful.


\section{Implementation Design}
\IEEEPARstart{N}{eural} networks consist of biologically inspired relationships between individual nodes (neurons). Learning in such a network occurs by intelligently adjusting weights on the links between the nodes. We define the relationship between nodes into the following three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] {\bf Static} - The network topology is fixed, and can only change by manually adjusting the relatiionship between nodes. Most neural networks fall into this category because regardless of the number of nodes \(n\), there is only one fixed relationship between them:

\[
\text{NumberOfTopologies}(n) = 1
\]


\item[(b)] {\bf Semi-Dynamic} - There is some freedom for nodes to rewire with other nodes in real time. The complexity grows polynomially. Each node has non-zero probablity to be rewired with a constant \(c\) number of other nodes. Given \(n\) such nodes, the number of possible topologies can be up to

\[
\text{NumberOfTopologies}(n) = n^c
\]


\item[(c)] {\bf Dynamic} - Each node has non-zero probability to be wired with any other neuron in the entire network. In this case, the complexity grows exponentially. Given \(n\) nodes, the number of possible topologies becomes

\[
\text{NumberOfTopologies}(n) = n^{n-1}
\]


\end{itemize}

A biological neural network such as the human brain is not static. Connections between neurons are regularily formed and removed over time. Moreover, such a neural network is not fully dynamic either, since locality is a physical constraint. For example, a neuron on the far end of the left hemisphere of a brain may never directly connect with a neuron over on the right hemisphere.

We designed a programming framework on SpiNNaker's API to enable a semi-dynamic network topology. In our implementation, each neuron had the flexibility to rewire with none, all, or some of the fixed number of other neurons. 



\section{Pitfalls}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{ome} disadvantages are present when considering our apprach for synaptogenesis on the SpiNNaker. [TODO: Matt] Blah blah.


\section{Further Study}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper reveals multiple questions that still need to be examined further. 


\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.


% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or

% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
